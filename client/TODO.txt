1. parse only the packet with encrypted flag set to false

2. Add a new field in packet that says that its a config stuff

3. If it says
		|=> "user" joined the chat
		|=> "user" left the chat
	then ask for the current list of users in the chat room
	server returns with a encrypted flag set to false and server must return data with a space
	separated name of all the online users

4. After recieving the client list
	|=> extract all the names from the data
	|=> sha hash all the names
	|=> create unique color based on that


-- example

txt := "loser";
hash := sha256.Sum256([]byte(txt)); // make utils.go hash to Hash so that we can use
fmt.Printf("%v\n", hash);
fmt.Printf("#%02x%02x%02x\n", hash[0], hash[1], hash[2]);
